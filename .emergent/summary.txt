The AI engineer has significantly advanced the Pizoo Dating App. Initial work covered internationalization, Sentry integration, Cloudinary image uploads, and legal/support page rendering. The major development involved migrating real-time communication from Jitsi to LiveKit, including backend token generation and frontend component integration.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing a one-time account verification system using Google OAuth and Email Magic Links, requiring database schema updates, new authentication endpoints, and careful handling of environment variables. The AI successfully debugged email sending issues (leading to a mock email service) and resolved critical React rendering errors caused by improper date serialization from the backend. Persistent issues with LiveKit URL configuration were also meticulously debugged and resolved by correcting environment variable loading.

Most recently, the AI has started a major branding overhaul, creating new SVG logos and a React component, as part of a larger monorepo migration. The current state reflects a functional verification system and LiveKit integration, with backend data now consistently JSON-safe. The AI is now tasked with continuing the branding update and monorepo setup, having just completed the initial file creation for the new logos.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested comprehensive internationalization, including dynamic language adaptation, RTL support, and a robust country code selector. This was followed by a product roadmap covering AI Matching, Admin Dashboard, Firebase Analytics, GDPR compliance, testing, monitoring, and documentation.

Recent explicit requests focused on:
1.  **Image Uploads & Country Codes**: Fixing a NotFoundError for image uploads and enhancing country code dropdowns.
2.  **Frontend/Backend Fixes**: Resolving React Error #31 (rendering objects in JSX), Failed to send message (CORS, backend URL, auth token), ensuring Cloudinary setup, and correctly rendering legal/support pages with i18n.
3.  **RTC Migration**: Migrating video/voice calling from Jitsi to LiveKit, requiring secure token generation, SDK integration, and camera/mic controls.
4.  **Self-Hosted LiveKit**: Deploying a self-hosted LiveKit stack on Hetzner VPS with an automated installation package (though this was temporarily paused in favor of LiveKit Cloud).
5.  **One-Time Account Verification**: Implementing a robust system for user verification at signup using OAuth (Google), Email Magic Links (SMTP), and eventually Phone OTP (Telnyx), with associated database changes, API modifications, JWT strategy, and frontend integration to gate features.
6.  **Backend Data Serialization**: Fixing  in message serialization.
7.  **Environment Configuration**: Creating a comprehensive and structured  and  file.
8.  **Service Integration Verification**: Confirming successful authorization and connection for various third-party services.
9.  **Monorepo Merge**: Restructuring the project into a monorepo with Turborepo/Nx, unifying package managers, and migrating existing repos.
10. **Branding Update**: Replacing the application branding with new PiZOO SVG logos, generating various PNG assets, outlining fonts within SVGs, and updating frontend imports.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on a comprehensive branding update for the Pizoo application. This task, received after the user provided a detailed monorepo merge plan, is a critical prerequisite for the larger refactoring.

The current work involves:
1.  **Creating the main PiZOO SVG logo**: A new  file has been created in  with a brand gradient and the PiZOO text using a specific font, intended to have a transparent background.
2.  **Creating a gold variant SVG logo**: A  file has been created in the same directory, offering an alternative gold gradient version of the new branding.
3.  **Developing a reusable React Logo component**: A  file has been created in  which is a React functional component designed to dynamically render either the  or  based on a  prop, with configurable width, height, and class names.

These foundational branding assets have been successfully created and are ready for the subsequent steps of the branding update. The AI has confirmed the files are written, and the next steps involve generating various PNG assets, PWA icons, optimizing SVGs, and integrating these into the frontend.

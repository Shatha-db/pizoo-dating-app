The AI engineer successfully progressed the Pizoo dating app through multiple feature additions and refinements. Initial work involved implementing internationalization (i18n), setting up free user limits for likes and messages, and enhancing existing UI components. This included integrating , creating translation files, adding a language switcher in , and modifying backend endpoints (, ) to enforce usage limits. A new  page was introduced with corresponding backend endpoints. Subsequently, the engineer focused on improving the login/registration flow with multi-option sign-up, revamping the user profile page, and implementing a friend invitation system with Double Dating features. Significant effort was also dedicated to the application's branding, specifically the Pizoo logo design. Several logo iterations were presented and revised based on user feedback, culminating in a custom design (PIZ∞) that the user provided as an image, which the AI engineer is now tasked to implement. Throughout these phases, the engineer consistently addressed bugs, refactored code (e.g., duplicate  class, bare  blocks), and ensured service stability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a detailed process of redesigning the Pizoo application's logo based on extensive user feedback. Initially, several logo options were presented, but the user requested a more specific, custom design. The user then provided an image () of a desired logo. The AI engineer successfully analyzed this image, identifying key elements: PIZ in a warm orange Serif font, intertwined rings (representing wedding rings) replacing OO, a hand-drawn style with detailed lines, and warm orange/creamy colors. A new  component was created to implement this specific design, and a  was set up to allow the user to preview this design. The custom logo has been applied to the , , and  pages for immediate user review. The frontend services were restarted, and a screenshot was provided, showing the new logo correctly applied.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Implement the custom PIZ∞ logo design, incorporating the intertwined rings and hand-drawn style as described from the user's provided image.

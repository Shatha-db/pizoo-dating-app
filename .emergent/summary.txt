The AI engineer successfully progressed through several complex development phases. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing a Turborepo monorepo migration, resolving various frontend and backend issues including hardcoded URLs, ESLint errors, and MongoDB connectivity. A significant task involved detailed MongoDB data seeding with demo users, which was completed, addressing schema compatibility and indexing. Subsequently, the engineer fixed user profile viewing logic and initiated CI/CD workflow fixes on GitHub Actions, encountering and resolving  dependency conflicts for Vercel deployments. The trajectory concludes with the engineer starting a comprehensive app review based on user-defined criteria, analyzing code structure and feature implementation. The key challenge observed was the inability to directly recover source code from a live Emergent deployment for a legacy merge task.

<product_requirements>
The Pizoo Dating App aims for enhanced functionality and stability. Initial requirements included i18n, Cloudinary integration, frontend/backend stability (CORS, auth, rendering), LiveKit RTC migration, account verification, MongoDB ObjectId fixes, monorepo migration, and Kubernetes readiness. Explicit recent tasks involved: ensuring environment variable usage for all URLs (no hardcoding), fixing frontend build/runtime errors (ESLint, React child errors), enabling phone-based login, stabilizing the bottom navigation bar, and seeding MongoDB with 400 demo users (350 female, 50 male) with specific attributes and AI-generated avatars. The user later requested enabling full user profile viewing for all logged-in users before liking/matching, fixing GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows, integrating Vercel deployment, and then merging features from an old Global-Dating-4 Emergent deployment into the current monorepo. The final request is a comprehensive app review to identify feature pass/fail, bugs, and improvements.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a comprehensive App Review for the Pizoo Dating App. This review entails evaluating all key features against defined criteria, identifying bugs, and recommending improvements. The engineer started by analyzing the project's code structure, specifically comparing the old (, ) and new monorepo (, ) structures. It was determined that the current monorepo already contains most of the required features. The engineer verified the presence and basic functionality of i18n, bottom navigation, LiveKit, Cloudinary, and authentication methods, as well as crucial environment variables. The review process is ongoing, currently in the initial phase of structural and feature verification.

The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the application from a subscription service to a feature-rich dating app, Pizoo. This involved extensive UI/UX implementation mirroring Tinder/Badoo, focusing on user authentication, a comprehensive profile system, discovery (swiping), matches, and a real-time chat. The engineer navigated several pivots and fixed numerous bugs, including persistent redirects and issues with feature functionality. Key achievements include a mock premium subscription, a full WebSocket-based chat, and a detailed settings page. Recent work involved fixing the Explore and Likes pages, redesigning the chat list, implementing a comprehensive profile editing page with Cloudinary image upload, and ensuring persistent login. Critical backend issues like missing  field in profile updates and automatic profile creation on registration were addressed. The current focus is on enhancing the app's global capabilities with i18n and defining free user limits, with the engineer currently setting up the internationalization framework.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested an annual subscription service with a free trial. This evolved into a full dating application, Pizoo, requiring a detailed user profile (photos, preferences, multi-step flow), discovery/matching with swipe functionality, real-time chat, and premium features (Gold/Platinum tiers, blurred Likes You). UI/UX was explicitly guided by Tinder/Badoo, including a 5-tab bottom navigation, explore categories, and detailed permissions. Post-pivot, requests included fixing the Explore page (tiles not opening), Likes page (profiles not opening/messaging), redesigning the chat list (Tinder-like matches row), and a comprehensive profile editing page (9-photo grid, detailed fields). Recent requirements extended to an actual image upload system (Cloudinary), persistent login, and the current global app features: automatic language detection with English as default (and Arabic support, changeable in settings), realistic dummy profiles, and free user limits (10 messages/week, 12 likes/week).

<pending_tasks>
- Implementing full internationalization (i18n) beyond basic setup (currently in progress).
- Refining the smart matching algorithm (initial changes made).
- Completing remaining animations and transitions.
- Developing advanced Phase 3 features (e.g., video dating, AI assistant).
- Implementing free user limits (10 messages/week, 12 likes/week).
- Generating dummy profiles with actual images (100+ profiles already generated, but images need to be integrated).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully addressed several critical issues:
1.  **Image Persistence:** Fixed the issue where uploaded profile photos were not saving by adding the  field to  in  and improving the  endpoint. Also, enhanced  to automatically set the first uploaded image as the primary profile photo, with the ability to change it.
2.  **Profile Creation:** Rectified the bug where new users did not have a profile by ensuring a default profile is created during registration and adding a fallback  endpoint.
3.  **Persistent Login:** Implemented the Remember Me functionality in  using  to maintain user sessions.

The user then requested new global app features: automatic language detection, enhanced dummy profiles, and free user limits. The AI engineer has begun implementing the **Internationalization (i18n)** system. Currently,  and  have been installed, and translation files (, ) have been created in . The engineer is now in the process of creating the  configuration file.

The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around two major feature sets: an iterative branding update and persistent Vercel deployment configuration challenges. The branding work involved multiple rounds of user feedback to precisely size, position, and color Pizoo logos (Classic Orange for external, Golden Glow for internal), ensuring transparent backgrounds and correct appearance across various React components like , , , , and . Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to troubleshooting Vercel deployment issues, which stemmed from incorrect  configurations,  settings, a misconfigured Git repository path on Vercel, and the critical problem of local changes not being pushed to GitHub. This required repeated attempts to correct build commands, output directories,  origins, and eventually culminated in successfully triggering and verifying a Vercel deploy hook, ensuring the application was live and functional on .

The Pizoo Dating App needs robust internationalization, AI matching, admin dashboard, analytics, and GDPR compliance. Recent explicit user requests focused on:
1.  **Email Standardization**: Update all system and contact emails to  with info Pizoo sender name across backend services (FastAPI, SMTP settings) and frontend pages (Contact, Help, Support).
2.  **Branding Updates**: Iteratively replace the application's logo with a new PiZOO design. This included creating Classic Orange (external) and Golden Glow (internal) SVG/PNG variants, generating PWA icons, favicons, updating  and , and integrating a unified  React component. Crucially, logos needed transparent backgrounds, specific sizing (larger for auth pages, proportionate for navbar), correct color (dark orange for external), and precise placement (close to top, minimal surrounding space).
3.  **Vercel Deployment Configuration**: Resolve 404 errors on  by correctly configuring  (build command, output directory, rewrites), creating , ensuring backend CORS for , and synchronizing the GitHub repository with Vercel for proper, up-to-date deployments.
4.  **Backend Fixes**: Address MongoDB  serialization and LiveKit URL configuration.
5.  **Account Verification**: Implement one-time account verification via OAuth and Email Magic Links.
6.  **Project Unification and Cleanup**: Merge all Pizoo-related projects into a single, organized codebase on GitHub, fix code redundancies, review and fill legal pages (شروطنا - Terms, سياسة الخصوصية - Privacy), and remove the ساعدونا (Help) page. Ensure video/voice calls function correctly.

-   ****: The core FastAPI application. Modified for  serialization, email references, and .
-   ****: Backend environment variables. Updated with  details and .
-   ****: Authentication service. Email sender/reply-to details updated.
-   ****: Centralized email service. , ,  constants updated.
-   ****: (New) Script to organize MongoDB collections and ensure proper indexing.
-   ****: Main React application router. Modified to remove the HelpSupport route.
-   ** & **: Authentication pages. Repeatedly modified to adjust the  (Classic Orange) sizing, vertical positioning, and surrounding padding, ensuring it's close to the top and visually prominent.
-   ****: Internal application page. Modified to adjust the  (Golden Glow) sizing for the navbar, making it proportionate to other UI elements like the bell icon and reducing padding.
-   ****: (Deleted) Removed as per user request to simplify support options.
-   ****: Settings page. Modified to remove the link to the deleted HelpSupport page.
-   ****: React logo component. Modified to introduce more granular  props (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) and their corresponding pixel widths, allowing for more precise control over logo display in different contexts.
-   ****: Unified logo component. Updated to dynamically render classic/golden logos based on  prop and accept  for sizing. The image sources (, ) are located in .
-   ****: Contains the source SVG/PNG files for the new logos.  (dark orange) and  (yellow-golden) were repeatedly updated for transparency and correct color.
-   ****: (Root level) Configuration file for Vercel deployment. Created, modified multiple times to correct , , , and  for React SPA, and eventually simplified/moved for better Vercel integration.
-   ****: (Frontend specific) Created to specifically handle React Router rewrites for SPA deployments.
-   ****: Specifies files/directories for Vercel to ignore. Modified to ensure  files are not ignored.
-   ****: (New) GitHub Actions workflow to trigger Vercel deployments automatically on  branch pushes using a deploy hook.
-   ****: (Root level) Created to provide a consistent , , and  for the monorepo, as well as Vercel-compatible build scripts.

<pending_tasks>
-   Build an Admin Web Dashboard (MVP with Next.js).
-   Implement Firebase Analytics.
-   Enhance GDPR compliance.
-   Implement E2E and API tests.
-   Set up comprehensive monitoring and observability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved the persistent Vercel deployment issues and verified the live application. The primary task was to ensure the  domain was serving the latest application code with correct branding.

The AI engineer:
1.  **Verified **: Confirmed the presence and correctness of  with appropriate build commands, output directory, and rewrites for a React SPA.
2.  **Triggered Deploy Hook**: Successfully executed a POST request to the provided Vercel Deploy Hook URL, initiating a new production build.
3.  **Monitored Deployment**: Waited for the Vercel build process to complete.
4.  **Verified Domain Endpoints**: Tested , , and  using  to confirm they returned a 200 OK status and displayed the latest content.
5.  **Verified React Routes**: Checked key frontend routes like , , , , and  to ensure they loaded correctly without 404 errors.
6.  **Confirmed Latest Build**: Inspected headers to confirm the  timestamp matched the recent deployment, indicating the latest code was live.
7.  **Created Documentation**: Generated  and  to document the fixes and guide the user on necessary Vercel Dashboard actions.

The application is now successfully deployed and accessible on  with all the latest branding and code changes. The automated deployment via GitHub Actions (using the Vercel Deploy Hook) is also configured and working.

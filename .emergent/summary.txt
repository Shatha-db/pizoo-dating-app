The AI engineer successfully guided the application from an initial subscription service to a feature-rich dating app, Pizoo. This involved a significant pivot, detailed UI/UX implementation based on user-provided references (Tinder/Badoo), and continuous iteration. Initial work focused on basic user authentication, a free trial model, and deployment troubleshooting. Post-pivot, the engineer built core dating features including comprehensive profile setup, discovery (swiping), matches, and a bottom navigation system. Challenges included persistent redirects to old subscription pages and an initial miscommunication regarding GitHub saves. Key achievements include implementing a mock premium subscription system, a full chat system with WebSocket real-time capabilities, and a detailed settings page. The engineer also performed extensive backend and frontend testing, diagnosing and fixing several issues, and ensuring all new features were integrated and functional. The work is currently in Phase 3, with real-time chat implemented, but with pending fixes for the 'Explore' and 'Likes' pages.

<product_requirements>
Initially, the user required an annual subscription service (33 CHF/month) with free registration, a 14-day trial, and mandatory payment details at signup. This evolved to optional payment post-trial and removal of specific branding and payment fields from registration. The project then pivoted to a full dating application, necessitating a detailed profile system (photos, preferences, one question per page flow, progress bars), discovery/matching (swipe functionality, smart matching), a chat system, and integrated paid features (premium tiers like Gold, Platinum, with blurred Likes You section). UI/UX was guided by Tinder/Badoo images, including a 5-tab bottom navigation, explore categories, and detailed permissions (camera, location). The app needed to support global users, language detection, and numerous realistic dummy profiles. Recent requests included enhanced Explore page design, a new likes pop-up, a Matchmaker feature, and a complete real-time chat system with safety consent, typing indicators, online status, and read receipts, along with a comprehensive settings page.

The core backend and frontend for chat, premium features, and settings are implemented and mostly functional. Backend APIs were thoroughly tested. Login redirects and registration pages have been fixed to reflect the dating app context. The real-time chat functionality via WebSockets, including typing indicators and online status, is also implemented in the UI and demonstrably working.

However, the user has reported two specific issues that need immediate attention:
1. The Explore page tiles do not open.
2. Likes page profiles cannot be opened or messaged.

The AI engineer has progressively built out the Pizoo Dating App, starting with foundational internationalization (i18n, RTL, country codes). Key milestones included integrating Sentry for error tracking, fixing rendering issues on the Discover page, and setting up Cloudinary for image uploads. A major architectural shift involved migrating the real-time communication system from Jitsi to LiveKit, which required extensive backend (token generation) and frontend (new components) work.

More recently, the focus shifted to implementing a robust one-time account verification system (OAuth, email magic link, phone OTP with a mock service). This involved significant updates to the backend user model, authentication endpoints, and LiveKit token authorization. Concurrently, critical backend serialization errors related to MongoDB ObjectIds were resolved, ensuring JSON-safe API responses. The AI also streamlined the application's environment configuration into a structured  file and conducted a comprehensive service integration verification. The current task involves a large-scale monorepo merge.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to enhance the Pizoo Dating App, an MVP-level application, by expanding functionality and fixing existing issues. Initial requirements included a comprehensive internationalization (i18n) system with dynamic language adaptation, RTL support, and a country code dropdown. Subsequent roadmap items covered AI Matching, an Admin Dashboard, Firebase Analytics, GDPR compliance, E2E/API testing, monitoring, performance, and documentation.

Recent explicit requests and their implementations include:
1.  **Image Upload & Language/Country Code:** Fixed NotFoundError for image uploads by enhancing Cloudinary integration and implemented comprehensive country code dropdowns.
2.  **Frontend/Backend Stability:** Resolved React Error #31 (rendering objects in JSX), fixed Failed to send message issues (CORS, backend URL, auth token), and ensured legal/support pages rendered correctly with i18n.
3.  **Real-Time Communication (RTC) Migration:** Migrated video/voice calls from Jitsi to LiveKit, involving secure token generation, SDK integration, and camera/microphone controls.
4.  **Self-Hosted LiveKit (Pending Deployment):** User requested a self-hosted LiveKit stack, for which an automated deployment package was being prepared, though the in-app integration currently uses LiveKit Cloud.
5.  **One-Time Account Verification:** Implemented a system where users are verified once at signup via OAuth, Email Magic Link, or Phone OTP. This involved adding , ,  fields to the user model, updating auth APIs, and gating LiveKit token generation on verification. A mock email service was set up for testing.
6.  **MongoDB ObjectId Serialization Fix:** Resolved  in message endpoints by ensuring all MongoDB ObjectIds are converted to strings before JSON serialization.
7.  **Environment Configuration:** Structured and normalized  configuration for all services.
8.  **Integration Verification:** Verified connectivity and permissions for GitHub, MongoDB, Hetzner, LiveKit, Cloudinary, and Sentry.
9.  **Monorepo Merge:** The current request is to refactor multiple repositories into a single monorepo with a Turborepo/Nx structure, unify package managers (pnpm), standardize configurations, and extract shared components.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in two main threads of work:
1.  **LiveKit Frontend Integration:** The user provided a specific React component () and instructions to integrate it into the chat UI, making the call button visible only to verified users. The AI identified that the  in the frontend  was incorrect and updated it. A persistent issue with  being incorrectly reported by the backend's  endpoint was debugged, tracing it to  execution order and a default value in , which was subsequently fixed. After these fixes, the backend was confirmed to return the correct LiveKit Cloud URL. The AI then proceeded to create two verified test users and successfully obtained LiveKit tokens, confirming the backend and verification gates were functional for LiveKit calls. The  was updated to include the verification check for the call button. The AI then created an implementation summary document ().
2.  **Monorepo Merge (Initiation):** Following the LiveKit work, the user provided an extensive task to merge several existing GitHub repositories into a single monorepo (), using a Turborepo/Nx workspace structure. This involves standardizing default branches, migrating codebases (web frontends to , FastAPI backend to ), unifying package managers to pnpm, centralizing configurations, extracting common components, and setting up CI/CD. The AI acknowledged this complex task, noting it would proceed after addressing a critical prerequisite.

The AI engineer will now begin the monorepo merge and normalization task as per the user's detailed request.
=======
The AI engineer successfully refactored a Pizoo dating app, transforming it from a static Arabic interface to a fully multilingual application with enhanced features. Initial challenges involved understanding the existing codebase, which was incomplete, leading to the user providing a GitHub repository. Extensive effort was dedicated to resolving GitHub push protection and secret scanning issues by creating a clean project environment. Key accomplishments include implementing a comprehensive i18n system for 9 languages, dynamically translating core pages like Terms, Register, and DoubleDating, and developing a  component. A significant addition was the backend AI Matching algorithm. The latest work focused on integrating Sentry for error tracking, which was successfully initialized and tested for the backend.
</analysis>

<product_requirements>
The user tasked the AI engineer with a comprehensive overhaul of a dating application. The core problems identified were:
1.  **Incomplete Language Translation**: The application did not fully switch to a selected language; many parts, including Terms and Conditions, remained static in Arabic. The user explicitly requested all pages, visible or not, to be dynamic based on user-selected language, with English as the primary.
2.  **Missing Country Code Dropdown**: For phone number registration, a dropdown for country codes was absent. The user requested its implementation with a good appearance.
3.  **Overall Refactoring and Improvement**: The user granted permission to add professional touches and adhere to global standards, indicating a desire for a launchable MVP.
4.  **AI Matching Feature**: A critical new feature requested was the integration of an AI Chat / Matching algorithm within the Discover page to provide intelligent suggestions.
5.  **Comprehensive Bug Fixing**: A general request to fix all errors and inconsistencies, specifically highlighting 1485 hardcoded Arabic texts across 20+ pages.

**Implementation Done So Far**:
*   **Multilingual Support**: Established a robust  system for 9 languages (EN, AR, FR, ES, DE, TR, IT, PT-BR, RU), including dynamic RTL/LTR support.
*   **Page Translations**: , , and  were fully refactored for dynamic language support.
*   **Country Code Selector**: A  component was created and integrated into .
*   **AI Matching Backend**: An  endpoint was developed in  with a sophisticated matching algorithm based on interests, age, location, activity, and profile completeness.
*   **Sentry Integration**: Sentry error tracking was integrated into the backend, including DSN configuration, PII tracking, and a debug endpoint.
